## NotABot

A Discord bot for personal use. Handles starboards, pins messages, and coordinates meetups. Uses [pycord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord).

This bot is very much a work in progress. Although I am trying my darndest to update the bot as frequently as I can, I am ultimately constrained by the fact that I have, what, 30 minutes a day to improve this guy? Oh well, you gotta make do with what you have.
